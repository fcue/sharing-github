1. Do you trust the mainstream media to report fairly on our presidency?
 Yes
 No
 No opinion
 Other, please specify:
 
    I would rephrase this form of questioning to get a measurement instead. For example, we can use: 
      a. Completely agree
      B. Agree
      C. Neutral
      D. Disagree
      E. Completely disagree
      
 2. Do you believe that the media sensationalizes and exaggerates stories in order to paint President Trump and conservatives in a bad light?
 Yes
 No
 No opinion
 Other, please specify:
 
    I would break this up into 2 questions. Do you believe the media portrays Trump and conservatives in a bad light? Do you believe
    the media sensationalizes and exaggerates stories about Trump and conservatives?
    
 3. On which issues does the mainstream media do the worst job of representing President Trump? (Select as many that apply.)
 Immigration
 Economics
 Radical Islamic Terrorism
 Pro-life values/social issues
 Religion
 Health care
 Second Amendment rights
 
    There should be an option to write in an answer here.
    
 4. Do you feel that the media is too eager to slur conservatives with baseless accusations of racism and sexism?
 Yes
 No
 No opinion
 Other, please specify:
 
    Racism and sexism are two separate issues. This should be two different questions. 
    
 5. Do you believe the media is biased when it covers President Trumpâ€™s restriction on immigration from countries compromised by radical Islamic terrorism?
 Yes
 No
 No opinion
 Other, please specify
 
    The phrase "from countries compromised by radical Islamic terrorism" is very vague. What countries are we talking about here?
    What organizations of radical Islamic terrorism? The questions should be as specific as can be so that we can get an accurate 
    survey response from the responders.

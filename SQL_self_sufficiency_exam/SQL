1. Write a query that allows you to inspect the schema of the naep table.

SELECT * FROM naep


2. Write a query that returns the first 50 records of the naep table.

SELECT * FROM naep
LIMIT 50;


3. Another good way to understand your data is to calculate various summary statistics.
Summary statistics can give you very useful information, such as where your data is centered and how spread out it is. 
These summary statistics include count, average, min, and max values.
Write a query that returns summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state. 
Make sure to sort the results alphabetically by state name.

SELECT 
	state, 
	AVG(avg_math_4_score) AS avg_scores,
	SUM(avg_math_4_score) AS total_scores,
	MAX(avg_math_4_score), 
	MIN(avg_math_4_score), 
	MAX(avg_math_4_score) - MIN(avg_math_4_score) AS range
FROM naep
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY state;

4. Write a query that alters the previous query so that it returns only the summary 
statistics for avg_math_4_score by state with differences in max 
and min values that are greater than 30.

SELECT 
	state, 
	AVG(avg_math_4_score) AS avg_scores,
	SUM(avg_math_4_score) AS total_scores,
	MAX(avg_math_4_score), 
	MIN(avg_math_4_score), 
	MAX(avg_math_4_score) - MIN(avg_math_4_score) AS range
FROM naep
GROUP BY state
HAVING (MAX(avg_math_4_score) - MIN(avg_math_4_score)) > 30
ORDER BY state;


5. Write a query that returns a field called bottom_10_states that lists the states in the bottom 
10 for avg_math_4_score in the year 2000.
SELECT state AS bottom_10_states
FROM naep
WHERE id LIKE '2000%'
ORDER BY avg_math_4_score
LIMIT 10;

6. Write a query that calculates the average avg_math_4_score rounded 
to the nearest 2 decimal places over all states in the year 2000.

SELECT ROUND(AVG(avg_math_4_score), 2)
FROM naep
WHERE id LIKE '2000%';

7. Write a query that returns a field called below_average_states_y2000 that 
lists all states with an avg_math_4_score less than the average over all states in the year 2000.


SELECT state AS below_average_states_y2000 
FROM naep
WHERE id LIKE '2000%'
AND avg_math_4_score < ANY(SELECT AVG(avg_math_4_score)
			   FROM naep
			   WHERE id LIKE '2000%')
ORDER BY avg_math_4_score;

8.Write a query that returns a field called scores_missing_y2000 that lists any states with missing values in 
the avg_math_4_score column of the naep data table for the year 2000.

SELECT state as scores_missing_y2000 
FROM naep
WHERE id LIKE '2000%' 
AND avg_math_4_score IS NULL;

9. Write a query that returns for the year 2000 the state, avg_math_4_score, 
and total_expenditure from the naep table left outer joined with the finance table, 
using id as the key and ordered by total_expenditure greatest to least. 
Be sure to round avg_math_4_score to the nearest 2 decimal places, 
and then filter out NULL avg_math_4_scores in order to see any correlation more clearly.

SELECT naep.state, ROUND(avg_math_4_score, 2), total_expenditure
FROM naep LEFT OUTER JOIN finance
ON naep.id = finance.id
WHERE naep.id LIKE '2000%'
AND avg_math_4_score IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY total_expenditure DESC;

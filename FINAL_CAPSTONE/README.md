This is my final capstone for the Thinkful Data Science Course. The goal of this this project is to be able to predict tweets that are indicative of the flu. The user, must be the one that is sick with the flu, not a family member or a friend. The data was collected from the Twitter API using streaming. Various key words search were utilized including 'sick', 'flu', 'fever', 'aches' and 'influenza'.

1. The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. 
Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." 
They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan.
In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, 
while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan 
and should continue to be used.

The sampling method used creates a bias. 50 "captured" droids already states that they are forced to be in the study. While "Anger" converted 
more, it is most likely because out of force. 
Proposal: Create a random sample that is not coerced into joining the study. 
Testing: A/B testing would be appropriate for this scenario.

2. In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four
friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi.
Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over
75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while 
only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is 
sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.


The selection of the sample is not random, a friendly environment, and the other unfriendly. Jar Jar will have more luck because he
was sent to friendly territory. Windu actually did pretty good with 65% considering he went to unfriendly territory. 

Proposal: Perhaps, both can go to unfriendly territory and from there promote favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Then sample will be similar.
Testing: A/B testing can be used.

3. A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources 
and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally 
distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job
satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.

Since HR workers are not distributed evenly unlike IT, there will be bias when the calculations for average job satisfaction for HR and IT. 
Proposal: It'd be better if you collect info from each country, instead of generalizing from five different countries. And it'd be even better if it is position
specific.

4. When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of 
physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, 
they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.

This might only recruit people who are interested in getting fit or exercise. It would only show participants that want to become active 
and track their activity. Plus, people are aware of being tracked, which makes them more "compliant" and become more active. 

Propasal: To use the app, ALL users must agree to have their physical activity tracked. This can still create bias because who downloads 
a fitness tracker however. Most people that download and use apps like these are interested in fitness but some may follow through with their
fitness goals and some may not.

5. To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, 
then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test.
When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or 
Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.

The only thing I can think of here is that the people that got Version B cheated. Since the tests were not randomly assigned, there is 
potential bias. Students could be sitting together, having the same exact tests, can easily give each other answers. 

Proposal: Give tests at random order. Randomized seating as well.

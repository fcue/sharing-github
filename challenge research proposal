Look back to the potential experiments in the previous assignment. 
For one of those experiments, write up the essential points of a research proposal for an 
improved version of that experiment.

****INCOMPLETE*****
Does a new supplement help people sleep better?

The problem
In this case, our problem is determining whether the new supplement helps people sleep.

The potential solution
Here you propose a hypothesis (potential explanation) to be tested. For example:
The new supplement can help improve the quality of sleep by having falling asleep faster and having uninterrupted sleep at night. 

The method of testing the solution
Describe the design of the experiment, the _analysis plan_, and _set benchmarks_:

We will have a randomized sample, between ages 21-40, equal amount of women and men. Our sample size will be 300.
Demographics are similar. Diagnosis of insomnia by a doctor within the past 2 years and have tried multiple medications/alternatives and failed to work. 

In the perfect world, we will conduct our experiment in a sleep lab for for 2 weeks, but this is unrealistic. Instead of this,
we can give participants a pre and post survey. We can compare the pre-test from the post-test results and record any changes.

In another version of this study, we can seperate the sample into two groups and give one group a placebo pill and the other, 
the sleeping supplement. Then we can use post test survey results and measure the quality of sleep from two groups. (A/B testing)

We can measure the differences between both groups, like hours of sleep, rate quality of sleep from 0-5. 5 being the best quality
sleep.

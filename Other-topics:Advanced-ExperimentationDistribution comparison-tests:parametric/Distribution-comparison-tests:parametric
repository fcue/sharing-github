Why use dependent groups? Come up with a few scenarios where getting repeated measures from the same people would be beneficial. 
Summarize them in your notebook and discuss with your mentor.

We use dependent groups if we want to test before and after on the same group. For example, we can try testing the 
effectiveness of a blood pressure medicine for immediate effect or immediate release. We take the same group with hypertension,
take their blood pressure, then give them the medicine, then take the same measurements and see if there is an effect.
